# jss21.4-nextjs-storybook7.4

This repository is a [Sitecore JSS](https://doc.sitecore.com/xp/en/developers/hd/21/sitecore-headless-development/sitecore-javascript-rendering-sdk--jss--for-next-js.html) 21.4 [Next.js sample application](https://github.com/Sitecore/jss/tree/v21.4.0/packages/create-sitecore-jss/src/templates/nextjs) created with `npx create-sitecore-jss --templates nextjs,nextjs-sxa` in which [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) 7.4 was added step by step (see the [commit history](/commits/main)).

This was created for educational purposes, to show how common use cases and errors can be handled, and to serve as material for presentations.

I hope you will learn something new.

Enjoy!
